		<p>I am a graduate student in the <a href="http://psych.la.psu.edu/">Cognitive Psychology
		  Department</a> at Penn State University. I work with Drs. Judith Kroll (Psychology)
		and Giuli Dussias (Spanish Linguistics) conducting psycholinguistic research in Bilingualism.
		<p>I started out at Penn State as  a &quot;Research Technologist&quot; in the <a href="http://cls.psu.edu">
		  Center for Language Science</a>. The CLS is an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psycholinguists,
		applied linguists, speech-language pathologists, speech scientists, and cognitive neuroscientists who 
		share a common interest in language acquisition and bilingualism. From 2007 - 2009, I was the resident
		webmaster for the CLS and conducted various administrative duties.</p>
		
	      <p>In addition to working in the Center for Language Science, I also spent a large amount of my 
		time working in the Spanish Department's Psycholinguistic Eyetracking Lab with Dr. Giuli Dussias. There, I helped
		to develop an eyetracking experiment using the Visual World Paradigm. The experiment explores the role of
		gender-marked articles in the processing of spoken Spanish-English codeswitched utterances. The results
		were presented recently at the Internation Symposium on Bilingualism in July 2009.</p>

		  I recieved my undergraduate degree in Linguistics and Psychology from The University of Massachusetts
		  Amherst. At UMass, I worked in the Sentence Processing Lab with Charles Clifton and Lyn Frazier. There
		  I got the experience of designing an experiment on which I wrote my undergraduate thesis 
		  (<a href="files.shtml">linked here</a>).

		<h3>Why psycholinguistics?</h3>
		<div class="eleven columns omega">
    <p>Language has always fascinated me. I first became interested
      in different languages when I was young. In elementary school, I couldn't wait for Middle School to
      come around because that meant I could start learning German. Then in college, after taking a few
      linguistics classes, I quickly realized that it wasn't just different languages that interested me,
      but language in general; specifically, how people produce and process language. </p>
