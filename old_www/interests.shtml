		<h1>Interests</h1>
		<p>Below are a few of my non-school-related
		interests. I realize I didn't get this page up for a
		while and I swear its not because I'm boring!</p>
		
		<ul>
		    <li>Cooking
		      <p>If, for some reason, I  ever give up on
		      psycholinguistics, I'd probably train to become
		      a chef.</p>
		      <p>Cooking is great! Not only can you make
		      whatever you're in the mood for, but if you're
		      feeling adventurous you can try something you've
		      never had before. All it takes is a trip to the
		      grocery store.</p>
		      <p>Ashley and I try to cook together almost
		      every night. I think you tend to eat healthier
		      foods if you aren't ordering out all the
		      time. Plus, once you get good you can make
		      better hot-wings!</p>
		      <p>Another reason I like cooking?  Probably
		      because it leads to another of my favorite
		      activities: eating!</p>

<p class="center" >Baking is fun too!</p>
		    </li>

		    <li>Computers
		        <p>Tinkering with computers is another
		        favorite pastime of mine. I recently ventured
		        into the world of Linux, and I'm happy to say
		        I'm not coming back (to Windows that is).</p>
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/"><img class="center blackborder"
				      src="files/UbuntuStrapLogo.png" alt="Ubuntu!"/></a>

		        
		        <p>I feel like every Linux user should have a
		        &quot;last straw&quot; event that cemented
		        their decision to switch. Mine was when a
		        fresh install of Windows XP recognized none of my hardware.
		        I tried installing Ubuntu and in 20 minutes (as
		        opposed to about an hour for Windows) I
		        was good to go. And people say that Linux
		        doesn't recognize hardware!</p>

		    </li>
		    <li>Outdoor Things
		        <p>Although I'm a computer geek, I do enjoy
		        being outside (although I <em>don't</em> tan.)
		        I love going to the swimming at beaches and
		        lakes. I could stay in the water all
		        day. Whenever I'm back home, I make it a
		        priority to go to the beach.</p>

			<p>I also like to go for the occasional hike
			in the woods. I'm looking forward to finding
			some places to hike around here this summer.</p>

			<p>A friend of mine built a camp up in the
			boonies of Maine with his family. His father's
			a carpenter, so they did it all by hand over
			the weekends. I tried to help out whenever I
			had the time. Initially it was just a plot of
			land where we would camp out. Now that land
			has an amazing house on it. The picture from
			below is from high school days when we were,
			I believe, putting up the roof of the house. </p>
