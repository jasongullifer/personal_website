	<strong>Papers I've Written</strong>
<ul>
	<li><a href="files/gullifer_sluicing.pdf">Processing Reverse Sluicing</a>
	<ul>
    <li>This paper investigates processing differences between sentences containing filler-gap
dependencies and sentences with a cataphoric form of ellipsis, reverse sluicing. The results provide
supporting evidence for an integral element of syntactic theory: that movement and ellipsis are two
distinct structures.</li>

</ul>

</ul>
<strong>Programs I've Written</strong>
<ul>


<li><a href="files/postField.py">postField</a> - Search multiple people on the PSU Directory</li>
   <ul>
     <li>Given an input file that contains a list of names on each line,
this program will look up each name Penn State Directory
(http://www.psu.edu/ldap/) and output the results for each name in a
HTML file.<br><br>

More generally, this program contains the method postField which can
be passed a URL, a search string, and a field name. It will then
submit that field to the URL as a POST request.<br><br>

To execute this program, use "python postField.py" and follow the usage guidelines. This program requires the pycurl module.</li>

    </ul>
<li><a href="files/command_line_scripts.py">Command Line Scripts</a></li>
	<ul>
    
    <li>This contains some scripts I've written in Python that I
	find useful and you might too! It was written originally for a
	Linux OS but should work on Windows as well. It currently
	contains only two functions, _listFiles() and
	bulkImageConvert().</li>

 <li>_listFiles() stores file names in to a variable. By itself it
 isn't very useful, but is required by
 bulkImageConvert(). </li>

<li>bulkImageConvert() will convert all files of a
 specified type to a new, specified type. It
 requires <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">imagemagick</a>
 to run. The function makes converting many images easier in that they
 don't have to be done one by one, or by an expensive program such as Photoshop. I recommend moving  your images to their own directory. This way no other files will be changed by accident (although this shouldn't happen). This won't overwrite your pictures.</li>
