	    <hr/>	    		
	    <p>Below are a few of my non-academic
	    interests.</p>
	    
	    <h3>Cooking</h3>
	      <p>If, for some reason, I  ever give up on
	      psycholinguistics, I'd probably train to become
	      a chef.</p>
	      <p>Cooking is great! Not only can you make
	      whatever you're in the mood for, but if you're
	      feeling adventurous you can try something you've
	      never had before. All it takes is a trip to the
	      grocery store.</p>
	      <p>Ashley and I try to cook together almost
	      every night. I think you tend to eat healthier
	      foods if you aren't ordering out all the
	      time. Plus, once you get good you can make
	      better hot-wings!</p>
	      <p>Another reason I like cooking?  Probably
	      because it leads to another of my favorite
	      activities: eating!</p>
	      <p class="center" >Baking is fun too!</p>

	      
	      <h3>Computers</h3>
	      <p>Tinkering with computers is another
	      favorite pastime of mine. I recently ventured
	      into the world of Linux, and I'm happy to say
	      I'm not coming back (to Windows that is).</p>
	      <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/"><img class="center blackborder"
	      src="files/UbuntuStrapLogo.png" alt="Ubuntu!"/></a>
	      
	      
	      <p>I feel like every Linux user should have a
	      &quot;last straw&quot; event that cemented
	      their decision to switch. Mine was when a
	      fresh install of Windows XP recognized none of my hardware.
	      I tried installing Ubuntu and in 20 minutes (as
	      opposed to about an hour for Windows) I
	      was good to go. And people say that Linux
	      doesn't recognize hardware!</p>
	      
	    <h3>The Great Outdoors</h3>
	      <p>Although I'm a computer nerd, I do enjoy being
	      outside. I love swimming and snorkeling; I could stay in
	      the water all day. Whenever I'm back home, I make it a
	      priority to go to the beach. There's less water in
	      Pennsylvania, but do enjoy hiking, especially if the hike involves 
	      vistas, mushroom collecting, photos, or combinations of
	      the three. </br>

	     </p>
	      
	      <p>In high school, a friend of mine built a home up in
	      northern Maine with his family. His father is a
	      carpenter, so they did it all by hand on the weekends. I
	      tried to help out whenever I had the time. Initially it
	      was just a plot of land where we would camp out. Now
	      that land has an amazing house on it. The picture below shows the groups of us, if I remember correctly,
	      after putting the roof on the house. </p>
